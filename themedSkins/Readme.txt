Make your owns skins with archive 7z in _assets,

save mask skins in "_assets/themedSkins/mask" with system name: mastersystem.png snes.png etc...
save menu skins in "_assets/themedSkins/menu" with system name: mastersystem.png snes.png etc...


Choose the right menu skin maker beetween normal and basic, for exemple: library and retrobat sections use menuBasic layer.

You can also use unique custom for all theme by creating and replacing the "default.png mask", "default.png" and "defaultBase".png menus in folders.

Default files are also use when a system is no present.
